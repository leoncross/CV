## Leon Cross 

I am an incredibly passionate and eager to learn junior developer who recently graduated from Makers Academy. Coming from a successful 8 year career in Project Management spanning large scale multi-million pound programs to grass-root start-ups, I am eager to get up to speed, contribute and be a functional part of the team.

#### Programming

During the 12 weeks at Makers, I was taught to code against a set of industry best-practices. This included following a strict TTD process, writing code that is DRY, all the while aligning to SOLID and OOD principles. Furthermore, working within a team structure that follows the XP values, and the agile product development cycle.

#### Quick learner

Makers Academy left me with a great knowledge of Ruby and JavaScript, but much more than that - the ability to teach myself new technologies quickly. After spending two months studying Ruby, I mastered JavaScript to a similar level in five days. Having now graduated from Makers, I am stretching my ability to learn new languages, and to understand the oddities of each - I am currently redoing the course material in Golang, and working on a new Python project

#### Project Management
I have considerable project management experience that includes both PRINCE2 and Agile methodologies gained from working on a number, including:
- Managing a large scale change program in Macmillan Cancer Supports fundraising function. Reporting straight to board level, this saw significant success, and led to a 13% improvement in compliance and 10% to quality across a £125 Million fundraising portfolio
- Designing, delivering and overseeing the implementation of a Project Management suite to an international audience spanning 14 regional offices at ARTICLE19
- Managed the delivery and conversion of a shipping container filled with medical supplies into a sustainable and government funded medical facility in rural Kenya.
